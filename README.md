Transaction Monitoring with SQL
This project demonstrates my ability to leverage SQL for effective transaction monitoring and fraud detection. Using publicly available financial transaction data from the World Data Center, I applied advanced SQL techniques to detect suspicious activities, monitor transaction patterns, and identify potential fraud.

Key Features
Transaction Analysis: Perform data analysis on transaction patterns such as high-value transfers, rapid transactions, and unusual geographical locations.
Fraud Detection: Apply SQL queries to flag potentially fraudulent transactions based on predefined risk criteria.
Data Visualization: Generate insights from transaction data using SQL-based aggregation and filtering techniques to provide a clear understanding of transaction trends and outliers.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project comes from the World Data Center, consisting of anonymized financial transactions. Key fields include transaction IDs, account details, transaction types, amounts, and timestamps, making it ideal for practicing and showcasing transaction monitoring techniques.

Why This Project?
In the financial industry, effective transaction monitoring is critical for preventing fraud and ensuring compliance with Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations. This project highlights my ability to implement SQL queries that can be used in real-world transaction monitoring systems.
